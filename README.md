# python-api-challenge




For the project, I encountered multiple problems that prevented me from finishing the code. The main problem I encourtered was that the progrom refused 
to select the cities and kept skipping over. To solve this, I used the BCS learning assisant tool but this still did not resolve the program. For the vacation 
progrom, the API refused to call evne when I generated a new API key. I also used Stack Overflow to help solve this but I was not able to find a solution.
